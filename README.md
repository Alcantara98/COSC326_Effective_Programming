#### Solutions for all 13 Etudes of COSC326 paper 2020.
### About
COSC326 is an undergrad Paper at the University of Otago, and is focused upon improving Problem Solving 
and Programming Logic skills. There are 13 Etudes/Tasks to complete of varying difficulties, most which 
have to be completed in pairs or groups.

### Personal Thoughts
I thoroughly enjoyed this paper and it most definitely improved my Problem Solving abilities.
Although feedback was provided for our code, they did not show us the optimal 
solutions for the problems. We improved our code until it was efficient enough, but they didn't mention if
we reached the optimal solution. It does, however, provide an incentive to come back and explore the problems again.
### Notable Etudes
* Etude04 was considered by many, including myself, to be the most difficult. 
Given a word and a dictionary containing potentially thousands of words, we had to find the best anagram.
The problem involved a lot sorting, the use of hashtables, and DFS.
* Etude03 was also difficult. The use of regex may have made it easier.
* Etude06 was nice. I had to use Java's Graphics Interface which I hadn't touched in a long time.
### Technologies
I mainly used Java in this paper since it's the language most of the other students were most familiar with.  
I also explored JS and Node a little in Etude13.
### Status
I passed the paper and have working solutions for each problem. Etude02 could be more efficient, and Etude03 could work on modularity.
