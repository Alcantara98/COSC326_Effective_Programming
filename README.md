### Notable Etudes
* Etude04 was considered by many, including myself, to be the most difficult. 
Given a word and a dictionary containing potentially thousands of words, we had to find the best anagram.
The problem involved a lot sorting, the use of hashtables, and DFS.
### Technologies
I mainly used Java in this paper since it's the language most of the other students were most familiar with.  
### Status
Etude02 could be more efficient, and Etude03 could work on modularity.
